The Super Secure Bank is not working very well.
We need to add some tests in order to understand what is not working.

# setup
- fork the project
- run 'nvm use'
- run 'npm install'
- run 'npm test' 

Feel free to add any other module that you feel it could be needed.

You can find the frontend here: https://github.com/nicolo-riboni-sp/qa-app-ui
And the backend here: https://github.com/nicolo-riboni-sp/qa-app-api

When ready submit a Pull Request.
